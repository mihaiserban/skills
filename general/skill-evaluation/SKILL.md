description: >
  Evaluate any agent skill against a merged framework — Anthropic's Claude Code
  best practices plus Matt Pocock's writing-great-skills methodology — across
  4 axes (Trigger, Structure, Steering, Pruning). Produces an evidence-cited
  scorecard (0–100), a weighted overall score, and diagnosed failure modes
  with prioritized fixes. Use when the user asks to evaluate, rate, or audit
  a skill ("evaluate this skill", "skill scorecard", "review SKILL.md"), or
  to compare two skills.

# Skill Evaluation

Read `references/mechanics.md` — the vocabulary and tests behind Axes 1, 3, and 4, including what makes a context pointer's wording effective.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `target` | Path to skill directory or SKILL.md to evaluate | Ask user |
| `output` | Path to write the scorecard | `<target>/EVALUATION.md` |
| `compare` | Optional second skill to compare side-by-side | None |

Also runs unattended: in CI, point `target` at skills changed in a PR and
gate with `scripts/score.py --fail-below 60 ...` — non-zero exit below the
threshold fails the check.

## Criteria

18 criteria: 14 core, scored on every skill, plus 4 conditional criteria
scored only when the skill's category makes them apply — otherwise mark
**N/A** and exclude the criterion from both the numerator and denominator of
the weighted average. Every score is 0–100 with evidence citing file,
section, or line.

### Axis 1 — Trigger (invocation)

| # | Criterion | Weight | Key question |
|---|-----------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Invocation design | 2x | Is model-invoked vs. user-invoked deliberate and fitting? Model-invoked pays **context load** (the description loads every turn); user-invoked pays **cognitive load** (the human is the index). A skill that only ever fires by hand should be user-invoked. |
| 2 | Description quality | 2x | Model-invoked: leading word up front, one trigger per branch (synonyms renaming the same branch are duplication), no identity that's redundant with the body. User-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true`): a human-facing one-liner, no trigger list. Score against the mode the skill actually uses — never penalize a user-invoked skill for lacking trigger phrases. |

### Axis 2 — Structure

| # | Criterion | Weight | Key question |
|---|-----------|--------|---------------|
| 3 | Steps vs. reference clarity | 1x | Does the skill distinguish ordered steps from on-demand reference? All-reference and all-steps skills are both valid — score clarity, not the mix. Is related material co-located (definition, rules, caveats under one heading)? |
| 4 | Branch-aware disclosure & pointers | 2x | Is material every branch needs inline, and material only some branches need behind a context pointer? Does each pointer's wording say when to follow it ("if you need X, read Y")? A weakly worded pointer to must-have material is a variance bug. |
| 5 | Conciseness (no sprawl) | 2x | Is SKILL.md lean — under 500 lines as a ceiling, smaller is better — with every line earning its context cost? |
| 6 | Coherent scope | 1x | Does the skill do one thing and compose with others, rather than covering too much? |

### Axis 3 — Steering

| # | Criterion | Weight | Key question |
|---|-----------|--------|---------------|
| 7 | Leading words | 2x | Does the skill use compact, high-prior terms ("vertical slice", "tight", "red") to anchor behavior, repeated consistently? Could any verbose passage collapse into one? |
| 8 | Completion criteria & legwork | 2x | Skills with steps: does each step end on a checkable, exhaustive completion criterion? A vague one invites premature completion. Skills that are pure reference: is there an exhaustiveness bar over the reference itself ("every rule applied")? If neither applies, mark N/A. |
| 9 | Gotchas section | 2x | Is there explicit capture of failure points, edge cases, footguns? |
| 10 | Grounded in expertise | 2x | Does content come from observed failures and real project facts, or generic "best practices"? |
| 11 | Avoids railroading | 1x | Does the skill leave room to adapt — procedures over declarations, defaults over menus — without over-prescribing? |

### Axis 4 — Pruning

| # | Criterion | Weight | Key question |
|---|-----------|--------|---------------|
| 12 | No-ops (deletion test) | 2x | Running the deletion test sentence by sentence: if removing a sentence leaves behavior unchanged, it's a no-op — including restatements of what the model already does by default. Cite line numbers for candidates. |
| 13 | Single source of truth | 1x | Does each meaning live in exactly one place? Duplication between SKILL.md and references/ counts too. |
| 14 | Relevance & sediment | 1x | Are there stale lines, accumulated layers, or material that no longer influences what the skill does? |

### Conditional criteria

Score only when the skill's category (from `references/categories.md`) makes
the criterion apply; otherwise mark N/A and drop it from the weighted
average entirely.

| # | Criterion | Weight | Applies to category |
|---|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| 15 | Setup flow | 1x | library-and-api-reference, data-fetching-and-analysis, ci-cd-and-deployment, infrastructure-operations |
| 16 | Memory mechanism | 1x | business-process-automation, data-fetching-and-analysis, runbooks |
| 17 | Scripts & libraries | 1x | product-verification, code-scaffolding-and-templates, code-quality-and-review, data-fetching-and-analysis, infrastructure-operations |
| 18 | On-demand hooks | 1x | code-quality-and-review, ci-cd-and-deployment |

Override this table with judgment, in either direction: score a criterion
for a skill outside these categories when it would clearly benefit (e.g., a
non-`product-verification` skill that obviously needs a helper script), and
mark it N/A even within an applicable category when the pattern doesn't fit
the skill's shape (e.g., a pure-reference vocabulary skill filed under
`code-quality-and-review` has nothing for a hook to enforce). Explain the
override in the scorecard either way.

## Scoring Guide

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | Not present at all |
| 1–25 | Minimal/token effort, barely addresses the criterion |
| 26–50 | Partially addressed but with significant gaps |
| 51–75 | Solid implementation with room for improvement |
| 76–90 | Strong implementation, minor gaps only |
| 91–100 | Exemplary — would use as a reference for others |

## Grade Scale

The grade is computed by `scripts/score.py`. See the script for the authoritative
grade mapping.

## Workflow

1. **Read the target skill** — SKILL.md, its frontmatter (check for
   `disable-model-invocation`), and every file in the skill directory.
2. **Read `references/mechanics.md`** — the vocabulary and tests Axes 1, 3,
   and 4 depend on, including what makes a context pointer's wording
   effective.
3. **Classify** — use `references/categories.md` and its decision tree to
   assign a category. The category determines which conditional criteria
   apply.
4. **Score all applicable criteria** — **cite-or-cut**: a criterion is only
   scored once its justification cites specific evidence (file, section, or
   line); no citation, no score. Mark N/A wherever the conditional table, or
   your own judgment, says a criterion doesn't apply. Verify cite-or-cut held
   everywhere before advancing. Done when every applicable criterion carries
   a score and a citation, and every N/A a reason.
5. **Diagnose failure modes** — done when every mode in the table below has
   been checked against the skill and either cited (file:line) or dismissed.
   Verify every mode is cited or dismissed before advancing.
6. **Assess bonus patterns** — the 4 carried over from v2.0, plus a fifth:

   | Bonus | Applies when | What to look for |
   |-------|-------------|-----------------|
   | Validation loops | Skill produces output or modifies state | Instructs the agent to self-check before finalizing |
   | Output templates | Skill generates structured output | Includes a concrete template/example of expected format |
   | Procedures over declarations | Skill teaches a method | Teaches *how to approach* problems, not *what to produce* for one case |
   | Defaults over menus | Skill offers tool/approach choices | Picks a clear default, mentions alternatives briefly |
   | Trace-checkable steering | Skill uses leading words | The leading words are distinctive enough that a user could grep the agent's reasoning traces to confirm the skill actually fired |

   Report each as Present / Absent / N/A. Verify all 5 are assessed before
   advancing.
7. **Compute the weighted score** — run `scripts/score.py` with one
   `criterion:score:weight` triple per criterion (score `NA` to exclude); it
   prints both sums, the overall, and the grade. Don't do this arithmetic by
   hand.
8. **Write the scorecard** to the output path — read
   `references/output-template.md` first (it also holds the comparison-mode
   template used when `compare` is set) and emit exactly that structure.

## Failure-mode diagnosis

Name the failure mode, cite evidence, prescribe the defense. Each mode's
defense is defined once in `references/mechanics.md` §5 — prescribe from
there. This replaces a generic "top improvements" list.

| Mode | Evidence to look for |
|------|----------------------|
| Premature completion | Vague completion criteria with future steps still visible |
| Weak steering | Instruction present but the agent doesn't reliably follow it |
| Duplication | Same meaning in 2+ places, including SKILL.md vs. references/ |
| Sediment | Stale layers, outdated references, dead instructions |
| Sprawl | Long even with no duplication or sediment |
| No-ops | Lines that don't change behavior versus the model's default |
| Buried steps | Inline reference so heavy it soaks the steps |

After the table, write a **Prioritized Actions** section: 3–5 highest-impact
actions derived directly from the detected failure modes, each citing its
evidence.

Note: **context overload** — too many model-invoked skills competing for
attention in one environment — is a portfolio-level problem, out of scope
for evaluating a single skill. Record the description's context-load cost
when it's notable; don't score the portfolio.

## Gotchas

- Tiny skills (under ~50 lines) flood the scorecard with N/A — score what's
  there; a small, sharp skill can reach grade A on few criteria.
- Self-evaluation bias: when the skill under review is one you (or this
  session) wrote, apply the deletion test with extra skepticism — you will
  want your own lines to matter.
- Fresh rewrites still carry duplication: sediment needs time to settle, but
  duplication can ship on day one. Run the pruning axis even on brand-new
  skills.
