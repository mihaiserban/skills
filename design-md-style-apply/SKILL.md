description: Apply a selected voltagent/awesome-design-md DESIGN.md aesthetic to an actual product UI, website, dashboard, app shell, or redesign. Use when the user names a style or brand from DESIGN.md, provides a DESIGN.md path, asks to build in the same style/aesthetic, or wants Codex to translate a reference design language into working frontend code.

# DESIGN.md Style Apply

## Overview

Turn a source `DESIGN.md` into a product-specific interface. The goal is not a themed skin; it is a coherent translation of the source's design DNA into the user's product, with real content, responsive behavior, and implementation details that match the existing codebase. If the project has `TASTE.md`, use it to decide what to emphasize, omit, and critique.

## Resolve the Source

If the user gives a path, read that `DESIGN.md` directly. If the user gives a brand, style, category, or mood, resolve it through the local checkout of `https://github.com/voltagent/awesome-design-md`:

```bash
python3 /Users/mitzuuuu/.agents/skills/scripts/design_md_catalog.py ensure
python3 /Users/mitzuuuu/.agents/skills/scripts/design_md_catalog.py search "linear precise project management"
python3 /Users/mitzuuuu/.agents/skills/scripts/design_md_catalog.py path linear.app
```

Load only the selected source file plus `references/translation-workflow.md` and `references/execution-discipline.md`. Also load the project `TASTE.md` if present. Do not load the entire catalog unless selection is still unresolved.

## Translation Workflow

1. Extract the source DNA:
   - atmosphere and product posture
   - color tokens and semantic roles
   - typography roles, weights, spacing, and casing
   - component geometry, state treatment, and density
   - layout rhythm, media strategy, and signature element
   - explicit do/don't constraints

2. Establish execution discipline:
   - write a one-line design read
   - infer layout variance, motion intensity, and visual density
   - lock accent, shape, type, theme, CTA language, and asset strategy
   - identify anti-default patterns that would weaken this brief

3. Map the DNA to the user's product:
   - replace source-specific content with real product concepts
   - adapt the signature element to the product's workflow
   - keep semantics intact, such as primary actions, warnings, code/data surfaces, or media moments
   - remove source brand marks, logos, slogans, proprietary product names, and exact hero copy
   - use `TASTE.md` to decide where to spend visual drama and what anti-patterns to avoid

4. Implement through the repo's existing patterns:
   - use existing framework, component structure, design tokens, icon library, routing, and state conventions
   - introduce CSS variables or token objects when the repo already uses tokens or the change spans multiple components
   - keep the edit scope tight unless a shared token layer is clearly needed

5. Verify visually:
   - run the app when possible
   - inspect desktop and mobile screenshots
   - check that the source's strongest constraints are visible in the implemented UI
   - fix text overflow, contrast, focus states, and responsive layout problems before finishing
   - run the preflight checks in `references/execution-discipline.md`

## Guardrails

- Do not produce a brand clone. Translate aesthetics, not identity.
- Do not mix multiple famous styles unless the user asks. A muddled hybrid usually feels less designed than a single strong source.
- Do not treat color alone as style. A successful translation also carries typography, spacing, density, component geometry, and interaction behavior.
- Do not ship generic default structure when the source style demands a stronger layout. Centered hero plus three cards is a fallback, not a design concept.
- Do not paste large chunks of `DESIGN.md` into the final answer. Summarize the applied decisions and point to the source path.
- Respect the product's domain. If a source style's hero-first marketing structure conflicts with a dense tool workflow, preserve its tokens and interaction grammar while designing the workspace first.
- When `TASTE.md` and `DESIGN.md` conflict, follow explicit user instructions first, then `TASTE.md` judgment, then source `DESIGN.md` details.

## Final Response

State the selected style, the source file, the main implementation changes, and how you verified them. If the output should be audited, invoke or follow `$design-md-style-audit`.
